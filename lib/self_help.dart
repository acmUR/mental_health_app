          '''Shift Out of Autopilot Eating: What did you have for breakfast? Be honest. Many people eat the same thing day in and day out. Notice whether you are stuck in any kind of rut or routine.
Take Mindful Bites: Did you ever eat an entire plate of food and not taste a single bite? Bring all of your senses to the dinner table. Breathe in the aroma of a fresh loaf of bread. Notice the texture of yogurt on your tongue. Truly taste your meal. Experience each bite from start to finish.
Attentive Eating: Sure, you’re busy and have a lot “on your plate.” It’s hard to make eating a priority rather than an option or side task. If you get the urge for a snack while doing your homework or studying, stop and take a break so that you can give eating 100% of your attention. Try to avoid multitasking while you eat. When you eat, just eat.
Mindfully Check In: How hungry am I on a scale of one to ten? Gauging your hunger level is a little like taking your temperature. Each time you eat, ask yourself, “Am I physically hungry?” Aim to eat until you are satisfied, leaving yourself neither stuffed nor still hungry.
Think Mindfully: Observe how self-critical thoughts like “I don’t want to gain the Freshman Fifteen,” or “I’m so stupid, how could I do that?” can creep into your consciousness. Just because you think these thoughts doesn’t mean you need to act on them or let them sway your emotions. Negative thoughts can trigger overeating or stop you from adequately feeding your hunger.
Remember: A thought is just a thought, not a fact.
Mindful Speech: Chit chatting about dieting and weight is so commonplace that we are often truly unaware of the impact it might have on our self-esteem. When you are with friends and family, be mindful of your gut reaction to “fat talk” (e.g., “I’m so fat!” or the “I’m so fat – No you’re not” debate). Keep in mind how the words might affect someone struggling with food issues.
Mindful Eating Support: Friends provide an enormous amount of support, but often it’s helpful to obtain assistance or a second opinion from a trained professional. If you would like to learn more about mindful eating, or if you have concerns about your eating habits, email CAPS at caps@richmond.edu, or consult the NEDA website for information and treatment referrals.

Having to experience race-related stress can be very exhausting and detrimental to an individual’s health. Below is a list of some of the negative impacts that race-related stress has on an individual:

Intense emotional reactions: anger anxiety fear frustration depression hopelessness isolation paranoia sadness self-blame self-doubt
Ineffective coping: avoidance disengaging substance use health concerns: heart disease hypertension muscle tension
Essentially, experiencing race-related stress can negatively impact an individual both psychologically and physically. For example, the John Henryism hypothesis states that individuals who experience stress for a prolonged period of time due to their racial identity are more likely to use a greater amount of energy and effort directed towards the stressful stimuli. This in turn, negatively impacts their physical health. For this reason, it is very important to help people of color actively cope with any stress that they may be experiencing, so that their health is not compromised in any way.''',

Additionally, joining groups focused around discussion of race and eliminating racism and discrimination around campus can be beneficial. There are many of these clubs on campus, in addition to open discussion events based around race, mindfulness, stress, and more which are hosted by different departments and organizations throughout the academic year.''',

In order to make an impact on the community, take what you learn from being an ally and attend open discussions and forums to contribute ideas to transforming our community into a more inclusive space.
